# ADR-0001 - Technology Stack
A lot of the research done supporting this decision can be found in the [Tech Stack](../tech-stack.md) document put together.

## Motivation
The application needs to have a technology stack to build and deploy.

## Decision
The sections below represent decisions made for each element of the technology stack.

#### [React Native (Typescript)](https://reactnative.dev/)
Serves as our 'front' end. This allows platform agnostic development which will work in iOS, Android and Windows using their native controls.

#### Deployment - [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/faq/)
Expo deals with a lot of the complication of deploying to the Android App Store and the Apple Store. It also makes deploying updates easier too. A list of features vs React Native out of the box can be found on their [Core Concepts](https://docs.expo.dev/core-concepts/) page.

#### Testing - [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
Jest comes with React Native, as I've not much experience with JS testing frameworks anyway, it makes sense to adopt the one closest to home. This is also a big hitter in the industry so it makes sense to learn.

#### Database - [Firebase]
Storage is separated into images and the data. As images must use a different product for storage

##### Storage (Local) - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/android/offline-capabilities#kotlin+ktx)
Originally I was going to use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) for offline data storage. However, I needed something that was NoSQL so backing up to my cloud storage was easily compatible with my cloud version (Firebase). After some research it looks like Firebase on React Native will actually support offline storage and sync when back online. Though I will want to ensure I can disable this for fully offline if the user isn't paying for premium features.

##### Storage (Cloud) - [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwhtWvBhD9ARIsAOP0GoiZGMV4nhcsyH1so4a7inMfFa11ngq60pHT3QUe3T8cL2t1TSeNQJwaAvbMEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
A NoSQL cloud database for storing documents. Any data 'backed up' will need to pass through this layer.

###### Images - [Cloud Storage for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage)
I don't get masses of storage here. Around `1gb` of free storage. I need to ensure that images are sensibly compressed by reducing resolution to suit viewing on a mobile phone.

###### [Firebase Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)
I'll need to be somewhat aware of what I'm storing as there are potential implications here when I reach a certain point. I should keep stored data as lean as possible for this reason.
