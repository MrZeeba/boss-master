# Linting

We use ESLint for our linting tool, this appears to be the most common and is also recommended by Expo.

As part of `package.json` a lint command has been provided named `lint`. You can run this by using `npm run lint`.

The configuration file for ESLint is situated in the root directory named `.eslintrc.cjs`.

It's recommended that you use Visual Studio Code as an IDE as we have a workspace configured which enforces linting and formatting on save.
