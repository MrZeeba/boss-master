# Getting Started

## Start Debugging
To start the metro server you can run. Metro bundles all of our files into a single `.js` executable.

`npm start`

OR 

`npx expo start`

You can now access the exposed URL on a mobile device to hit the web version, or on the PC to hit a browser version.

There are two ways to connect to the app. Either via an emulated device or my actual phone.

#### Emulated

1. Open Android Studio
2. More Actions > Virtual Device Manager
2. Select a phone and click the play/run icon

#### Phone Handset
You can either hit the URL in a web browser to get a browser version. Or use the Expo play store app.
