# ADR-0001 - Technology Stack
A lot of the research done supporting this decision can be found in the [Tech Stack](../tech-stack.md) document put together.

## Motivation
The application needs to have a technology stack to build and deploy.

## Decision
The sections below represent decisions made for each element of the technology stack.

#### [React Native (Typescript)](https://reactnative.dev/)
Serves as our 'front' end. This allows platform agnostic development which will work in iOS, Android and Windows using their native controls.

#### Deployment - [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/faq/)
Expo deals with a lot of the complication of deploying to the Android App Store and the Apple Store. It also makes deploying updates easier too. A list of features vs React Native out of the box can be found on their [Core Concepts](https://docs.expo.dev/core-concepts/) page.

#### Testing - [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
Jest comes with React Native, as I've not much experience with JS testing frameworks anyway, it makes sense to adopt the one closest to home. This is also a big hitter in the industry so it makes sense to learn.

##### Storage (Local) -  [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
SQLite is widely supported and easy to use. It allows me to use SQL which I'm already familiar with so reduces a barrier to entry. It's also free to use and portable as the output is a `.db` file which can be opened in tools on most PC's
